# Problem Motivation and Literature

## Why is DTP Vaccination a Social Problem?

DTP vaccination, protecting against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, is a cornerstone of global public health. It is one of the most cost-effective interventions, preventing an estimated 4.4 million deaths annually (UNICEF, 2024). Despite its proven effectiveness and inclusion in nearly all national immunization schedules, millions of children worldwide remain under-vaccinated or entirely unvaccinated. In 2023 alone, approximately 21 million children were either unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, with 14.5 million receiving no vaccines at all (UNICEF, 2024). This gap in coverage leads to preventable illness, long-term disability, and death, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (Our World in Data, sd). The issue is not merely medical but deeply social, as it reflects and reinforces inequalities in access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure (UNICEF, 2024).

Vaccination coverage is also a proxy for the strength of a country’s healthcare system. Low DTP coverage often signals broader systemic issues such as poverty, conflict, misinformation, and weak governance. These factors disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, making DTP vaccination a critical indicator of social justice and equity (UNICEF, 2024).

## Research Question

**"How does government healthcare spending per capita correlate with national vaccination coverage rates for routine immunizations in low-, middle-, and high-income countries?"**

## Sources Identifying DTP Vaccination as a Social Problem

- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** and **UNICEF** have jointly warned that vaccine-preventable diseases, including diphtheria, are resurging due to declining immunization coverage, misinformation, and funding cuts. They emphasize that millions of children are at risk, and urgent investment in immunization is needed to prevent a reversal of decades of progress (WHO Media Team, 2025).

- **UNICEF** outlines the severe consequences of DTP-preventable diseases. Diphtheria can cause heart and nerve damage, tetanus is often fatal even with treatment, and pertussis can lead to pneumonia and death in infants. These diseases disproportionately affect children in low-resource settings, highlighting the social dimension of under-vaccination (UNICEF, sd).

- A **UNICEF data report** on DTP vaccine dropout rates shows that millions of children start but do not complete the DTP series. This dropout is especially prevalent in low-income countries and is linked to systemic barriers such as healthcare access, education, and infrastructure (Wang et al., 2019).

## What Has Not Been Fully Researched

While many studies have examined DTP coverage and its determinants, there is limited comparative analysis across income groups that links government healthcare spending per capita directly to national DTP vaccination rates. Most existing research focuses on either micro-level determinants (e.g., parental education, rural access) or macro-level trends without integrating economic policy variables. UNICEF notes that while DTP3 coverage is widely used as a marker of how well countries provide routine immunization, disparities persist, and economic factors such as national healthcare investment are often underexplored in comparative frameworks (UNICEF, 2024).

## Contribution of This Report

This report aims to fill that gap by analyzing how government healthcare spending correlates with DTP vaccination coverage across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. This research will provide new insights into whether increased public investment in health translates into better immunization outcomes. This could inform both global health policy and economic development strategies, especially in resource-constrained settings.

## Suitability for the Research Topic

The research question investigates the relationship between government healthcare spending and DTP vaccination coverage across income groups. These datasets are ideal because:

- They are comprehensive and global, enabling cross-country comparisons.  
- They are updated annually, supporting time-series or cross-sectional analysis.  
- They are standardized and well-documented, ensuring data quality and reproducibility.  

## Data Limitations

Despite their strengths, both datasets have limitations:

### WHO DTP Coverage

- Some countries have missing or estimated values, especially in conflict zones.  
- Coverage estimates may be influenced by reporting biases or survey recall errors.  
- The data may not fully reflect subnational disparities in vaccination access.  

### World Bank Health Spending

- Spending data are in current US dollars, which may be affected by inflation and exchange rate fluctuations.  
- The data do not indicate how funds are allocated (e.g., toward immunization vs. other services).  
- Some countries have incomplete or outdated records for recent years.  

These limitations mean that while the analysis can reveal correlations, it cannot establish causality or account for all contextual factors.

# Quantifying

## Data Cleaning

To prepare the datasets for analysis, we performed several cleaning steps to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility across sources.

### Health Spending Data

We began by selecting the relevant columns from the raw health spending dataset and renaming them for clarity. We also ensured that the `Year` and `Spending` columns were numeric to support time-based analysis. This step was essential to align the data with the DTP vaccination dataset, which also uses `Region` and `Year` as key identifiers.

### DTP Vaccination Coverage Data

Next, we filtered the immunization dataset to include only WHO regions and WUENIC estimates, which are considered the most reliable. We also created a new variable, `PeriodGroup`, to group years into meaningful intervals for trend analysis. This transformation allows us to analyze changes in vaccination coverage over time in a more interpretable way.

### Child Mortality Data

We also prepared the child mortality dataset by selecting and renaming relevant columns, and converting values to numeric types. This ensures that the dataset can be merged with the others on `Region` and `Year`.


### Error Handling and Fixes

During the cleaning process, we encountered several common issues:

- **Missing values (`NA`)**: These were removed using `na.omit()` or filtered out using `filter(!is.na(...))` to ensure clean merges.
- **Non-numeric values**: Some columns were read as character types and had to be converted using `as.numeric()`.
- **Inconsistent region names**: We verified that region names matched across datasets. In an ideal scenario, standardized region codes (e.g., ISO or WHO codes) would be used to avoid ambiguity.
- **Data alignment**: We ensured that all datasets used the same time format and level of aggregation (annual, by WHO region).

## Necessary Variable

To analyze trends over time, we created a **period variable** for each dataset to group years into meaningful intervals. This allows us to compare average values across consistent time blocks.

### Health Spending

We created a new variable `Period` in the health spending dataset using `mutate()` and `case_when()`. We then calculated the **average health spending** per region and period.

- **Variables used**: `Spending`, `Region`, `Period`  
- **Purpose**: Calculates average health spending per region and period.  
- **Usefulness**: Highlights regional differences and trends in health investment.  
- **Intended analysis**: Visualize and compare health spending across time and regions.

### DTP Vaccination Coverage

For the DTP dataset, we used an existing variable `PeriodGroup` (created earlier) and calculated the **average vaccination coverage** per region and period.

- **Variables used**: `Coverage`, `Region`, `PeriodGroup`  
- **Purpose**: Computes average DTP vaccine coverage per region and period.  
- **Usefulness**: Evaluates immunization program effectiveness.  
- **Intended analysis**: Track vaccine coverage trends and relate to health outcomes

### Child Mortality

We also created a `Period` variable for the child mortality dataset. We then summarized the **average number of child deaths** per region and period:

- **Variables used**: `Deaths`, `Region`, `Period`  
- **Purpose**: Calculates average child deaths per region and period.  
- **Usefulness**: Measures health outcomes and can be linked to spending and coverage.  
- **Intended analysis**: Identify regions with high or declining child mortality and explore correlations.

These variables allow us to compare trends in health spending, vaccination coverage, and child mortality across WHO regions and over time.

## Merging Datasets

To analyze the relationship between healthcare spending, DTP vaccination coverage, and child mortality, it was necessary to combine all three datasets into a single, unified structure. This required several preparatory steps:

Standardizing Region Names
The Region variable in the DTP dataset used full WHO region names (e.g., "African Region"), while the other datasets used shorter or slightly different labels (e.g., "Africa"). To ensure consistency, I used mutate() and recode() to align the region names across datasets:

Merging the Datasets
I used inner_join() to merge the three datasets by Region and Period. This ensures that only rows with matching region-period combinations across all datasets are included:

Creating New Variables
To enrich the analysis, we constructed new variables that express relationships between the indicators:

Final Formatting
The merged tibble was converted to a standard data frame for compatibility with certain functions:

This merged dataset forms the foundation for the correlation analysis and visualizations that follow.

# Visualization

## Spatial Visualization

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Map.png")
```

### Spatial Analysis of DTP3 Vaccination Coverage (2020–2022)

This world map visualizes average DTP3 vaccination coverage by WHO region from 2020 to 2022, using a color gradient from purple (60%) to yellow (100%). The map reveals clear regional disparities: high-income regions such as Europe and the Western Pacific generally exhibit higher coverage (light green to yellow), while lower-income regions like Africa and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean show lower coverage (purple to blue). 

#### Spatial Anomalies and Regional Comparisons

Notably, some middle-income regions, such as parts of South-East Asia, achieve relatively high coverage despite lower spending levels, suggesting efficient immunization programs. Conversely, certain countries in the Americas show unexpectedly moderate coverage despite higher average spending, indicating potential inefficiencies or access barriers.

#### Interpretation and Mapping Critique

The map effectively communicates broad regional trends but may obscure within-region variation due to aggregation. For example, large countries with internal disparities (e.g., India, Brazil) are represented by a single color, which may oversimplify complex national dynamics. Additionally, the use of discrete color bands may exaggerate differences between countries near category thresholds.

#### Mapping Choices

While the color scheme is intuitive and accessible, a continuous gradient or country-level granularity could enhance interpretability. Including data labels or interactive elements (in a web-based version) would further support detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, the map serves as a compelling visual summary of global immunization equity and supports the research question by highlighting spatial patterns in vaccination coverage relative to regional healthcare investment.

### Temporal Trends in Health Investment and Outcomes

These two line graphs visualize how healthcare efficiency and outcomes have evolved across WHO regions over five-year periods from 2000 to 2022. They align closely with the research question by showing how healthcare spending relates to vaccination coverage and child mortality over time.

#### Graph 1: Child Deaths per Spending over Time

- **What it shows**: The number of child deaths per unit of healthcare spending.
- **Trend**: A clear downward trend across all regions, indicating improved outcomes per dollar spent.
- **Notable pattern**: Africa and Europe show the most significant declines, suggesting major gains in healthcare efficiency or effectiveness.
- **Interpretation**: This trend reflects global progress in reducing child mortality, likely due to better-targeted spending, improved healthcare delivery, and expanded immunization coverage.

#### Graph 2: Dollar per Coverage Point over Time

- **What it shows**: The average cost (in USD) required to increase DTP3 vaccination coverage by one percentage point.
- **Trend**: Most regions show a relatively stable or slightly increasing cost over time.
- **Notable pattern**: The Western Pacific region shows a significant increase in cost per coverage point in recent years, suggesting rising marginal costs or reduced efficiency.
- **Interpretation**: While some regions maintain cost-effectiveness, others may be facing diminishing returns on investment in immunization programs.

#### Comparison and Dynamics

- **Efficiency vs. Outcome**: While the cost of achieving additional vaccination coverage is rising or stabilizing, the impact of spending on reducing child deaths is improving.
- **Temporal Insight**: These trends highlight the evolving dynamics of global health investment—where spending may be increasing, but so is its effectiveness in saving lives.

#### Implications

- Policymakers should consider both cost and outcome metrics when evaluating healthcare strategies.
- The rising cost per coverage point in some regions may call for more efficient delivery models or targeted interventions.
- The declining child deaths per spending metric is a positive signal of global health progress and a justification for continued investment.


## Sub-Population Visualization


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("subpopulation.png")
```

### Subgroup Analysis: Top vs Bottom 3 WHO Regions (2022)

This bar chart compares the top 3 and bottom 3 WHO regions based on average healthcare spending per capita in 2022. It visualizes three key metrics:

- **Average Health Spending (USD per capita)**
- **Average DTP3 Vaccination Coverage (%)**
- **Average Child Deaths**

#### Alignment with Research Topic

This visualization directly supports the research question:  
*"How does government healthcare spending per capita correlate with national vaccination coverage rates for routine immunisations?"*

By dividing regions into high- and low-spending groups, the plot highlights how investment levels relate to health outcomes across sub-populations.

#### Group Differences (Quantified)

| Metric       | Top 3 Regions | Bottom 3 Regions | Difference       |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Spending     | \$1852.7       | \$305.9           | +\$1546.8        |
| Coverage     | 91%            | 82%               | +9%              |
| Child Deaths | 149,154.7      | 1,516,736.3       | −1,367,581.6     |

- Top 3 regions spend over **6 times more** per capita on healthcare.
- They achieve **9 percentage points higher** vaccination coverage.
- They experience nearly **10 times fewer** child deaths.

#### Evaluation of Subgroup Analysis

This subgroup comparison reveals a clear gradient: higher spending is associated with better vaccination outcomes and significantly lower child mortality. The differences are not only statistically meaningful but also socially and ethically significant, especially in the context of global health equity.

#### Implications

- **Policy Insight**: The data suggests that increasing healthcare investment in underfunded regions could substantially improve immunization coverage and reduce child mortality.
- **Equity Concern**: The stark contrast in child death rates underscores the urgent need for targeted support in low-spending regions.
- **Further Research**: This analysis invites deeper exploration into how efficiently funds are used and what other systemic factors (e.g., governance, infrastructure) influence outcomes.



## Event Analysis

Applying the findings related to the correlation between government healthcare spending per capita and national vaccination coverage rates worldwide, we can analyse a critical event period from 2020 to 2022 which relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike earlier gradual reforms such as GAVI's 2011-2015 financing activities (Phase 3 (2011–2015), 2025),  the pandemic created an acute simultaneous shock to every healthcare system worldwide. This situation enables a unique opportunity to examine how external crises affect  healthcare spending and vaccination coverage rates worldwide.

During COVID-19 routine immunizations were suspended or decreased as healthcare systems focused on pandemic response, meaning coverage declined regardless of funding. (Abad-Vergara, 2020).

Due to global lockdowns and border restrictions another major disruption was on the supply chain, as the struggle to transport vaccinations across borders and maintain cold storage systems increased, leading to decreased vaccination availability. Increasingly relevant to this study, a decrease in 7.7% DTP3 vaccine coverage worldwide was recognized compared to expected doses delivered in the absence of COVID (Causey & et., 2021).

The child deaths per spending data reveals a steady improvement pre COVID-19, but stagnation set during the pandemic in some regions. African regions kept stable child deaths per spending through the pandemic, suggesting resilience strategies such as community health worker programs which focused on under-five care while more formal health systems were focused on COVID related health issues. These systems, despite staffing shortages and movement restriction, prevented many children' deaths. (VanderZanden & et., 2024) However, the data might overstate these results as increased child mortality due to COVID-related health issues complicate the interpretation of spending efficiency.

The global coverage map reveals sharp regional disparities during 2020-2022, ranging from 60% to close to 100%. Underscoring, the disparity of pre-existing health care systems' resilience and adaptive mechanisms. Childhood vaccines declines were more prominent in low and lower-middle income countries (Lai & et., 2023), reaffirming that more developed countries with better resourced health systems managed to sustain coverage more effectively under strain.

Subpopulation comparisons show African regions maintained a 82% coverage during the pandemic while top performing regions achieved 91%. This supports the argument that stronger systems, such as the ones in Europe, were better equipped  to mitigate coverage maintenance challenges.

Finally, the dollar per coverage point data shows a sudden spike in costs, which suggests that it became much more expensive to maintain coverage during the pandemic. Disrupted supply chains and service suspensions meant fewer doses were delivered while, while fixed costs such as cold chains remained. This then signficantly increased the per-point cost. 

### 3.7.1 Interpretation and Relevance

The data reveals a relationship between healthcare spending and improved vaccination coverage, which broke down during COVID-19. The sharp decline of cost-efficiency, highlighted the vulnerability of highyl bureaucratic, centralized systems. Meanwhile, low-income regions maintained results through crisis proof, community-based delivery models. Though causality is inferred rather than proven, the timing supports a strong link. These findings stress that adaptability, not just funding, is crucial for sustaining vaccination efforts during systemic shocks.

# Part 4 - Discussion

Over the course of the analysis linking vaccination coverage trends to COVID-19, strong temporal evidence has emerged, suggesting a causal relationship rather than a coincidental one. This challenges theories of stable, linear relationships between government healthcare spending and vaccination coverages. Three key insights are identified:

Crisis-state exception: Traditional vaccination coverage models operate assume stability and predictability, yet COVID-19 expose that without dynamic frameworks addressing both normal and crisis-states, systems can collapse under acute pressure.

System resilience hierarchy: A new hierarchy of system resilience emerged, slicing through traditional income classifications. Community-based delivery systems such as the ones in Rwanda and Bangladesh (VanderZanden & et., 2024) outperformend more institutionalized systems in wealthier nations. This reveals the vulnerability that comes with highly institutionalized systems during crisis.

Resource Mobilization Capacity: The cost spike due to supply chain disruptions underscores the need for rapid, flexible spending responses. Echoing Keynes' view, static spending-outcome models are insufficient in volatile contexts.

A core takeaway is that resilient delivery systems are key to react to sudden disruptions. The superior performance of community-based systems suggests that advanced economies should explore more decentralized, locally-controlled mechanisms to maintain healthcare standards during major events.

Moreover, the shortcomings of highly complex systems could direct policy makers to evaluate the efficiency of complex and integrated systems during crises. The varied regional responses to the pandemic era disclose poor international coordination, with each region managing responses independently. Advocating once more for more flexible, decentralized international response frameworks.

## 4.1 Discuss our findings

Our most significant finding is that complex, well-funded healthcare systems experienced the greatest efficiency losses during the pandemic, whereas simpler, less-funded systems proved resilience. Europe maintained >90% coverage but had dramatic cost increases from \$25 to \$31 per coverage point during COVID. On the other hand, African regions maintained stable child deaths per spending ratios despite having the lowest spending levels.

Traditional income classifications were deemed flawed to predict pandemic resilience. In turn, system design characteristics such as degree of centralization and institutional complexity became the main differentiator between regions' adaptability to disruptions. Community-based systems' adaptive capacity prevailed over highly institutionalized systems' tendency to create multiple failure points, requiring major resource mobilization.

The findings of this study challenge core health economics assumptions and suggests the need for dynamic models, capable to adapt to stable and unstable environments. For policy implementation, the superior performance of community-based systems drags the topic of pandemic preparedness to a more decentralized approach.
